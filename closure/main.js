// Advanced exercises

// The Cat 
// Write yourself a virtual cat - animals with a CLI are so much nicer than ones with fur.

// Create an object that represents a cat. It should have properties for tiredness, hunger, lonliness and happiness
// Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".
// Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area. (Be creative e.g. Paws is really hungry, Paws is VERY happy.)
// Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts
// Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - sometimes make it so the cat doesn't want to be petted.
